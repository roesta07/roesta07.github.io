I am a data scientist with a robust background in both observational and experimental studies.

Taught myself statistics reading Richard McElreath’s book cover to cover and thoroughly exploring Andrew Gelman’s blog posts. These resources offered diverse perspectives on data analysis that expanded my understanding. Additionally, engaging with a supportive online community of like-minded individuals helped me address any misconceptions and identify areas needing further study.

After gaining substantial experience in observational studies, I transitioned to clinical research. This move provided me with valuable insights into experimental methodologies, broadening my knowledge and skill set in data analysis.

As time went on, I found myself increasingly drawn to exploring causal questions rather than focusing solely on predictions. I began to appreciate the practical applications of probability theory and its relevance in understanding causal relationships.
